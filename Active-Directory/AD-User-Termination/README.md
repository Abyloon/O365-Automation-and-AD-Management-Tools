# Active Directory Termination Script

## Overview

This PowerShell script is designed to simplify the termination process for user accounts in a hybrid Active Directory (AD) and Exchange Online environment. It performs several key tasks:

- Validates the existence of the user in AD.
- Resets the user’s password.
- Converts the mailbox to a shared mailbox and hides it from address lists.
- Clears calendar events organized by the user.
- Removes the user from all AD groups (except the primary group).
- Updates the user’s AD description field with termination details.
- Disables the user’s AD account.
- Moves the account to a designated “Disabled” Organizational Unit (OU).
- Prompts for and validates a ticket number (e.g., `REQ1234567`) to document the action.

**Note:** The domain and paths (like `skystar.com`, `Disabled Sync` OU) are placeholders and should be replaced with the correct values for your organization.

## Prerequisites

- **Active Directory Module:**  
  Ensure the Active Directory module is installed and imported:
  ```powershell
  Import-Module ActiveDirectory
  ```

- **Exchange Online Connectivity:**  
  You must have the Exchange Online PowerShell module installed and be connected:
  ```powershell
  Connect-ExchangeOnline
  ```

  Running this script in an Exchange-enabled PowerShell session ensures mailbox-related commands work properly.

- **Permissions:**  
  You will need appropriate administrative permissions in both AD and Exchange Online environments to modify user accounts, convert mailboxes, and remove group memberships.

## Usage

1. **Open a PowerShell Session:**  
   Ideally, use the Exchange Management Shell or a PowerShell session with the Exchange Online module loaded and connected.

2. **Navigate to the Script Location:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Path\To\Your\Script\
   ```

3. **Execution Policy (if needed):**
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

4. **Run the Script:**
   ```powershell
   .\AD-O365Hybrid-Termination.ps1
   ```

5. **Follow the Prompts:**
   - Enter the username (LAN ID) of the user being terminated.
   - Enter a valid ticket number (e.g., `REQ1234567`).
   - The script will perform the termination actions and prompt you at the end to confirm if you have taken all necessary screenshots.

## Notes

- **Ticket Number Format:**
  The script requires a `REQ` prefix followed by 7 digits (total length = 10 characters). Example: `REQ1234567`.

- **Username Validation:**
  The script ensures the provided username exists in AD and does not contain invalid characters.

- **Hidden Shared Mailbox:**
  After termination, the user’s mailbox is converted to a shared mailbox and hidden from the address lists to prevent accidental use.

- **Removing Groups:**
  The script removes all group memberships (except the primary group), ensuring the terminated user no longer has access to resources.

- **Error Handling:**
  If invalid input is provided (e.g., username not found, incorrect ticket format), the script will prompt you to re-enter until valid input is provided.
